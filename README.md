# BinaryGame
A short binary game which I made for the OLC Code Jam 2022. You play using the Terminal. Procedural music track. No dependencies - Pure C++

I saw the main gameplay of this game on the Site Rosetta Code. I developed its features keeping in mind my will to do a game in the Terminal. It does not use any dependencies - only pure C++ and a clever way to create a music track by a single algorythm. Cool stuff ++
